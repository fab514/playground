# Write your notes in markdown

Let's go ahead and write some introductory text here.

## Now we have a secondary heading

- let's have a list next
- here is another list item

Lists are surrounded by blank lines. So are code fences.

```txt
Code fences have the type of code marked by the extension on the opening fence. This helps with syntax highlighting.
```

```js
const this = 'javascript with syntax highlighting';
```

[We can also have links](https://www.google.com)

But if we put an exclamation point before the brackets...

We have an image!

### Headings should increase or decrease one level

And headings do not end in punctuation.

## But there should only be one level one heading.

`# this would not be acceptable a second time`

That was a neat inline code snippet, right?

Don't forget to end your markdown with a blank line.
