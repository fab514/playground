# TroubleShooting
## Commenting
- If you have trouble commenting in your vs code go to Edit->Toggle Line Comment (for single lines) or Edit->Toggle Block Comment (for blocks of Code)
- For src (source) comments use <!--<script src=>>

## Overriding eslint
- To block overide eslint put in /* eslint-disabled */
- If there is a variable that is not used you can disable eslint by using // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars // 
- Error messages will give you the option to disable eslint for that one error.
