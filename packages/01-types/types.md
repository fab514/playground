# Types
Values into variables, can be stuck in a variable or pass to a function like console.log. Whenever you use values in your code it fall under one of the 7 types of values.

Types of values
- SNOB'N'US
- String- whenever you have a line of text. 
- Numbers- whenever you use numbers. These numbers do not have decimal.
- Boolean- when you are using true or false statements
- Null- set to nothing
- Undefined- set to nothing
- Symbol- unique identifier. Can be used to make the identifier unique against other identifiers.
- Object- all things in javascript are considered objects.

## Type: Strings
- 'Single' "Double" and `Back ticks` can be used. Back ticks can be used to stop breaking the java script. If you want to put a word with 's that will break the code. If you would like to use single quotes you can use escaping. 
- Escaping the break of code. Back slashes will cancel out unwanted code. 'she/'s so cute' Without backslash the JS code will stop at 'she'.
- When wanting to use multiple lines in code use `back ticks`. This is helpful when using HTML.
`I
Love 
it`
## concatination
- When two or more strings are combined into one. 
```js
const hello = 'hello my name is' + name + ". Nice to meet you";
```
## Deprecarted
- This page lists features of JavaScript that are deprecated (that is, still available but planned for removal) and obsolete (that is, no longer usable)
## interpelation
- When you put a variable inside of a string. 
 templateLiteral = `${name} ${middle} ${last}`;

 ## Other types of string
 
 const hello = `Hello my name is ${name}. Nice to meet you. I am ${1 + 100} years old.`;

const html = `
    <div>
        <h2>name</h2>
        <p>hello</p>
    </div> 
   `;

document.body.innerHTML = html;
console.log(html);

# Number
{Dan question- can I have multiple js sources in the same html file? Also, why did I have a hard time with commenting function}
## typeof 
The typeof command in your console will show the type of variable you are using in that command.
- [in vs code] const age = '100' const name = 'felicia'
- [in browser console] typeof name "string" typeof age "number"
- You can also use type of in just the console. ex. typeof 11 is number and typeof 12312 is string
- Looking up typeof in console is good for if you are getting information from a user. 
## Numbers
- You can use an interger (a full number) ex. 100 3 etc.
- a decimal is called a float ex. 100.5 7.3 etc.
- Use const of smaller number to create addition, subtraction, multiplication and division equations (operators) in console.

- in vs code numbers can be listed a = 10; b = 20; In the console if you type a + b the value will show 30. 

- Be careful when using the + symbol in javascipt. This symbol is also used in concatination. If you mix up 2 types such as 1 + "1" = 11 (or a number + a string) it will come up with a unpredictable result. multiplication, division and subtraction are only used with numbers so the result for "10" * "10" will still be considered numbers instead of strings. 
## Math Helpers
- in the console there are several options of Math helpers. 
- The 4 that will be used the most are Math.round (round to the closest interger ex. 10.3=10, 8.9=9), Math.floor(will bring the decimal to the lower interger ex. 9.9= 9), Math.ceil(will bring the decimal to the higher interger ex. 1.4=2) and Math.random(will give you a random number{interger or decimal} from 0-10).
- Modulo (remainder %) is another type of operations. Equal to what is left over after the left number is divided by the right. 8 % 3 will return as two because 3 goes in 8 two times and 2 will be the remainder. 
- Floating Point Math A Computer can natively only store intergers so they need to find a way to represent decimals which is not always accurate.{.1 + .2 = .300000004}This can be fixed by using cents intead of dollars and cents. {Instead of doing 10.34 use 1034, when display to a costumer bring back to 10.34}
- ** is to the power of, so 10 ** 2 =100. 
- If a number goes too high or two low where the computer does understand it will bring back infinity or -infinity. (these will both be defined as true numbers when using typeof)
- NaN (Not a Number) If you try to use operations with something that is not a number you will see NaN. {ex. 10 / 'dog' = NaN}. When using the command typeof NaN it will however be listed as a number. 
# Null and Undefined 
- two types of variables that stand for nothing. 
## undefined
- If you create a variable but is not set to a value when you try to access it will be shown as undefined (or not yet defined). 
- Unlike undefined which is a created variable, trying to access something that has not been made into a variable will cause a reference error. 
-(ex. const cher = {first: 'cher'})
## Null
- Is a variable that is set to null (which means nothing). 
- {const somethingnull = null}
- You use null when you mean to set a value to nothing. 
- Teller from Penn and Teller changed his first name to his last name.His first name is now Teller and he does not have a last name. 
const teller = {first: 'Raymond', last: 'Teller'}; teller.first = 'teller'; teller.last = 'null'
# Booleans and Equality
## Booleans
- Booleans mean true or false. (on or off)
- Can be used for logic set or [if] statements.
- Could be used for number values < > = whether it is true of false.
- const age = 18; const ofAge = age > 19; consol.log(ofAge) *This will be answered as false because the age variable of 18 is not greater then 19. 
- Using a triple equal (===) is good practice, don't use double equal.
- The reason for the triple equal is that it will check both the value and the type of each side. 10 === 10 (true, both mumbers) "10" === 10 (false, string and number). 10 == 10 (true) "10" = 10 (true, double equals does not check if the type is the same.)
- Booleans can show if two variables are equal to each other. let age = 100; let age2 = 100; (in console age === age2 will be true)
- booleans are important in flow control (talked about later in course).
